# Trading Bot

A project for automated trading that leverages advanced data handling, simulation, and machine learning tools.

## Overview

The Trading Bot project is designed to:
- Fetch and process forex data.
- Run simulations and training using ray-based libraries.
- Securely manage sensitive API keys and configuration details.
- Provide a robust, test-driven framework for future enhancements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using your preferred Python environment.
3. Set up environment variables for sensitive configurations such as API keys.
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Roadmap
